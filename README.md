# Big-data
This project explores Big Data Processing and Machine Learning with Apache Spark, using DataFrames for transformation, MLlib for scalable model training, and RDDs for distributed computing. It demonstrates efficient data handling, model optimisation, and parallel processing for large-scale datasets.
